# Lab2: Network Cable Construction

**Aim:** Study of different types of Network cables and Practically implement the cross-wired cable and straight-through cable using a clamping tool.

**Required Components:**
- RJ-45 connector
- Crimping Tool
- Twisted pair Cable

**Procedure:**
Follow these steps carefully to complete the practical:

### 1. Initial Cable Preparation
- Strip approximately 5 centimeters of the plastic jacket from the cable end.
- Exercise extreme caution to avoid nicking or cutting the internal wires.
- Any damage to internal wires can alter cable characteristics or render it unusable.
- Inspect wires for nicks or cuts.
- If damage is found, cut off the entire end and restart.

### 2. Wire Management
- Spread the wires apart while holding the jacket base with your other hand.
- Prevent wires from becoming untwisted inside the jacket.
- **Category 5 cable specifications require:**
  - Only 1.3 centimeters of untwisted wire at the end.
  - Anything more will be "out of spec."
- **Note:** At this stage, you will have more than 1.3 centimeters exposed â€“ this is temporary.

### 3. Jack Installation
- Two end jacks must be installed on your cable.
- For pre-made cables with one end cut off:
  - Only need to install the crossed-over end.
- Reference the diagrams below for proper wire arrangement.

### Wire Color Arrangements

**End 1:**
1. White/Orange
2. Orange
3. White/Green
4. Blue
5. White/Blue

2. Green
3. White/Orange
4. Blue
5. White/Blue
6. Orange
7. White/Brown
8. Brown

#### Straight-Through Connection
Both ends use identical wire arrangement as End 1 above:
1. White/Orange
2. Orange
3. White/Green
4. Blue
5. White/Blue

### Quality Control Steps
#### Pre-Crimping Checks:
1. Verify correct wire order.
2. Confirm proper strip length.
3. Check for wire damage.
4. Ensure cable jacket will be inside the connector.

#### Post-Crimping Verification:
1. Test for proper connection.
2. Check connector attachment.
3. Verify cable flexibility.
4. Ensure proper seating of all wires.

### Required Tools
1. RJ-45 connectors (multiple, in case of errors).
2. Professional crimping tool.
3. Network cable.
4. Wire stripper (if not included in the crimping tool).
5. Cable tester (recommended).

### Submission Guidelines
1. **Take a Picture of Your Cable:**
   - Ensure the cable and its connections are clearly visible.
   - Place your name on a piece of paper next to the cable in the photo, or digitally label the photo with your name.
2. **Upload to Google Classroom:**
   - Submit the photo under the designated assignment.
   - Include any additional requested information (e.g., the type of cable and process description).
