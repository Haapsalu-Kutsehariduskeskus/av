## Understanding IP Address Assignment in This Lab

### Where Do All These IPs Come From?

Students often have questions about the different IP addresses used in this lab. Here's a clear explanation:

### The 10.0.2.x Addresses (WAN/Internet Side)

1. **Where they come from**: These IPs are automatically assigned by VirtualBox's built-in NAT feature
   
2. **How they're assigned**:
   - When you set Adapter 1 to "NAT" in VirtualBox settings
   - VirtualBox creates a virtual NAT network (usually 10.0.2.0/24)
   - VirtualBox runs its own DHCP server on this network
   - Your VM automatically gets an IP (usually 10.0.2.15)
   - The virtual gateway is 10.0.2.2
   - The virtual DNS server is 10.0.2.3

3. **What students need to do**:
   - Just set Adapter 1 to "NAT" in VirtualBox
   - In Ubuntu, make sure the interface is set to DHCP
   - That's it! VirtualBox handles everything else automatically

4. **How to check it's working**:
   ```bash
   ip addr
   ```
   You should see one interface (usually enp0s3) with an IP like 10.0.2.15

   ```bash
   ip route
   ```
   You should see a default route via 10.0.2.2

### The 192.168.56.x Addresses (LAN Side)

1. **Where they come from**:
   - VirtualBox creates a "Host-only Network" on your computer
   - Your computer gets 192.168.56.1 on this network
   - You manually assign 192.168.56.2 to your router VM
   - Your router's DHCP server assigns 192.168.56.100-200 to clients

2. **How to check your host-only network**:
   - In VirtualBox, go to File ‚Üí Host Network Manager
   - Look for the adapter with an IP like 192.168.56.1
   - Note: Some systems might use a different range like 192.168.99.x

3. **What students need to do**:
   - Set Adapter 2 to "Host-only Adapter" in VirtualBox
   - Manually configure the LAN interface with a static IP (192.168.56.2)
   - Set up DHCP server to give out IPs in range 192.168.56.100-200

## Part 1: Setting Up VMs in VirtualBox

### Creating the Router VM

1. **Open VirtualBox** and click "New"

2. **Basic VM Settings**:
   - Name: `router-YOUR_NAME` (use your actual name)
   - Type: Linux
   - Version: Ubuntu (64-bit)
   - Memory: 2048 MB (2GB)
   - Create a virtual hard disk (8GB, VDI, Dynamically allocated)

3. **Configure Network Adapters**:
   - Select the router VM and click "Settings"
   - Go to "Network" tab
   
   **For Adapter 1 (WAN/Internet)**:
   - Attached to: NAT
   - Advanced: Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
   
   **For Adapter 2 (LAN)**:
   - Click the "Adapter 2" tab
   - Enable Network Adapter: Checked
   - Attached to: Host-only Adapter
   - Name: Select your VirtualBox Host-Only adapter (if unsure, check the "Host Network Manager" first)
   - Advanced: Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop

### Creating Client VMs

1. **Create New VM**:
   - Name: `client1-YOUR_NAME` (use your name)
   - Type: Linux
   - Version: Ubuntu (64-bit)
   - Memory: 1024 MB (1GB)
   - Create a virtual hard disk (4GB, VDI, Dynamically allocated)

2. **Configure Network**:
   - Select the client VM and click "Settings"
   - Go to "Network" tab
   - Enable Network Adapter: Checked
   - Attached to: Host-only Adapter
   - Name: Same host-only adapter you chose for the router's Adapter 2
   - Advanced: Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop

3. **Repeat for Client2 and Client3** if desired

### Installing Ubuntu

For each VM (router and clients):

1. **Start the VM** and select your Ubuntu ISO
2. Choose "Install Ubuntu" and follow the installation wizard
3. Select "Minimal installation" to save space
4. Choose "Erase disk and install Ubuntu"
5. Create a user account and password
6. After installation, restart the VM and remove the installation media

## Part 2: Setting Up the Router VM

### Method 1: Configure Network Directly in VirtualBox (Beginner-Friendly)

The most important network configuration happens directly in VirtualBox:

1. **Check your host-only network configuration**:
   - In VirtualBox, go to File ‚Üí Host Network Manager
   - Note the IPv4 Address of your host-only adapter (typically 192.168.56.1)
   - Make sure DHCP Server is disabled for this network

2. **Configure Router VM adapters** (as described above):
   - Adapter 1: NAT (for internet)
   - Adapter 2: Host-only Adapter (for LAN)

3. **Inside the router VM**, you just need to set a static IP for the LAN interface:

   First, identify your interfaces:
   ```bash
   ip addr
   ```

   Look for two interfaces besides loopback (lo):
   - One with an IP like 10.0.2.15 (this is your WAN interface, usually enp0s3)
   - One that might not have an IP yet (this is your LAN interface, usually enp0s8)

   Install required packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y net-tools iptables isc-dhcp-server dnsmasq
   ```

### Method 2: Configure Network Inside Ubuntu (For Complete Control)

Inside the router VM, you need to configure both network interfaces:

1. **Create/edit netplan configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
   ```

2. **Add this configuration** (adjust interface names if needed):
   ```yaml
   network:
     version: 2
     renderer: networkd
     ethernets:
       enp0s3:    # WAN interface (change if yours is different)
         dhcp4: true
       enp0s8:    # LAN interface (change if yours is different)
         addresses: [192.168.56.2/24]
   ```

   **Understanding this configuration**:
   - `network:`: Main section for network config
   - `version: 2`: The netplan format version
   - `renderer: networkd`: Ubuntu's network management system
   - `ethernets:`: Section for wired connections
   - `enp0s3:`: First network adapter (WAN)
   - `dhcp4: true`: Get internet IP automatically
   - `enp0s8:`: Second network adapter (LAN)
   - `addresses: [192.168.56.2/24]`: Set static IP for LAN

   **IMPORTANT**: YAML files are strict about spaces and indentation:
   - Use exactly 2 spaces for each indentation level
   - No tabs allowed, only spaces
   - Be careful with alignment

3. **Apply network configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo netplan apply
   ```

4. **Verify configuration**:
   ```bash
   ip addr
   ```
   - WAN interface (enp0s3): Should have IP like 10.0.2.15
   - LAN interface (enp0s8): Should have IP 192.168.56.2

### Setting Up Router Services

Regardless of which network setup method you chose, continue with these steps:

1. **Configure DHCP Server** (to give IPs to clients):
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
   ```

   Find and modify:
   ```
   INTERFACESv4="enp0s8"   # Use your LAN interface name
   ```

   Create DHCP configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
   ```

   Add to the end of file:
   ```
   # Our LAN configuration
   subnet 192.168.56.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
     range 192.168.56.100 192.168.56.200;  # IP range to give out
     option routers 192.168.56.2;          # Router address
     option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8;   # DNS servers
   }
   ```

2. **Configure DNS Server**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
   ```

   Add to the end of file:
   ```
   # DNS configuration
   interface=enp0s8                    # LAN interface
   listen-address=127.0.0.1,192.168.56.2
   bind-interfaces
   server=8.8.8.8                     # Google DNS
   server=8.8.4.4                     # Backup DNS
   ```

3. **Enable IP Forwarding** (to allow clients to access internet):
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
   ```

   Find and uncomment (remove #):
   ```
   net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   ```

   Apply change immediately:
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -p
   ```

4. **Set Up NAT** (Network Address Translation):
   ```bash
   # Allow clients to access internet through router
   sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE

   # Allow established connections
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i enp0s8 -o enp0s3 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

   # Allow outbound connections
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i enp0s8 -o enp0s3 -j ACCEPT
   ```

   Save rules permanently:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y iptables-persistent
   ```
   When prompted, select "Yes" to save rules.

5. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
   sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
   ```

## Part 3: Testing Your Router Setup

### From the Router VM

1. **Check Network Configuration**:
   ```bash
   ip addr
   ip route
   ```

2. **Check Internet Connectivity**:
   ```bash
   ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
   ping -c 4 google.com
   ```

3. **Verify NAT Configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -L
   cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  # Should show "1"
   ```

4. **Check Service Status**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
   sudo systemctl status dnsmasq
   ```

### From Client VMs

1. **Configure Network** (if needed):
   - On each client VM, the network adapter should be set to Host-only
   - It should automatically get IP from your router's DHCP server
   - If not, try: `sudo dhclient`

2. **Check Network Configuration**:
   ```bash
   ip addr
   ip route
   ```
   Verify:
   - IP is in range 192.168.56.100-200
   - Default route is through 192.168.56.2 (router)

3. **Test Connectivity**:
   ```bash
   # Test connection to router
   ping -c 4 192.168.56.2

   # Test internet connectivity
   ping -c 4 8.8.8.8

   # Test DNS resolution
   nslookup google.com
   ```

## Verification Steps: How to Check Your Router Setup

### 1. Verify Router Network Configuration

On your router VM, run these commands to check the network setup:

```bash
# Check network interfaces and their IP addresses
ip addr

# Verify you see:
# - WAN interface (enp0s3) with an IP from VirtualBox NAT (usually 10.0.2.x)
# - LAN interface (enp0s8) with IP 192.168.56.2
```

```bash
# Check routing table
ip route

# Verify you see:
# - Default route via your WAN interface
# - Direct route to your LAN subnet
```

```bash
# Check internet connectivity from router
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8

# All 4 pings should be successful
```

### 2. Verify NAT and Forwarding Configuration

On your router VM, check that IP forwarding and NAT are properly configured:

```bash
# Check if IP forwarding is enabled
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

# Should output "1"
```

```bash
# Check NAT rules
sudo iptables -t nat -L

# Should show a POSTROUTING rule with MASQUERADE for your WAN interface
```

### 3. Verify DHCP Server Operation

On your router VM, check the DHCP server status:

```bash
# Check if DHCP server is running
sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server

# Should show "active (running)"
```

```bash
# Check DHCP leases
cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases

# Should show leases for your client VMs
```

### 4. Verify DNS Service

On your router VM, check the DNS service:

```bash
# Check if DNS service is running
sudo systemctl status dnsmasq

# Should show "active (running)"
```

```bash
# Test DNS resolution on router
nslookup google.com

# Should resolve to Google's IP addresses
```

### 5. Verify Client Network Configuration

On each client VM, check their network configuration:

```bash
# Check network interface and IP address
ip addr

# Verify client has an IP in your DHCP range (192.168.56.100-200)
```

```bash
# Check routing table
ip route

# Verify default route goes through router (192.168.56.2)
```

```bash
# Check connection to router
ping -c 4 192.168.56.2

# All 4 pings should be successful
```

### 6. Verify Client Internet Connectivity

On each client VM, verify internet access:

```bash
# Check if client can access internet
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8

# All 4 pings should be successful
```

```bash
# Check if DNS resolution works
nslookup google.com

# Should resolve to Google's IP addresses
```

```bash
# Try accessing a website (if GUI available)
firefox google.com

# Should load Google homepage
```

### 7. Verify Cross-Client Communication

Test if clients can communicate with each other:

```bash
# From client1, ping client2 (use its actual IP)
ping -c 4 192.168.56.101  # Adjust IP if different

# All 4 pings should be successful
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Network Interface Names Different?

If your network interfaces aren't named enp0s3 and enp0s8, check their actual names:
```bash
ip addr
```
Use the correct names in all configuration files.

### DHCP Not Working?

1. Check DHCP server status:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
   ```

2. Check DHCP server configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
   ```
   Make sure subnet matches your network.

3. Check DHCP server logs:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u isc-dhcp-server -n 50
   ```

### No Internet on Clients?

1. Check router forwarding:
   ```bash
   cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
   ```
   Should show "1".

2. Check NAT rules:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -L
   ```
   Should show MASQUERADE rule.

3. Check client routing:
   ```bash
   ip route
   ```
   Default route should go through router (192.168.56.2).

### DNS Not Working?

1. Check DNS service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status dnsmasq
   ```

2. Test DNS resolution manually:
   ```bash
   nslookup google.com 8.8.8.8
   ```

3. Check DNS configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
   ```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why do I need two different IP ranges?**
A: Your router connects two different networks:
   - The WAN side (10.0.2.x) connects to the internet
   - The LAN side (192.168.56.x) connects to your client VMs
   This is exactly how home routers work - they join your home network to the internet.

**Q: What if my host-only network uses a different IP range?**
A: It's fine! Just adjust your configurations to match:
   - If your host-only network is 192.168.99.x:
   - Use 192.168.99.2 for your router's LAN IP
   - Set DHCP range to 192.168.99.100-200
   - Update all config files accordingly

**Q: What if the 10.0.2.x address doesn't appear automatically?**
A: Check that:
   - Adapter 1 is set to "NAT" in VirtualBox
   - The interface is configured for DHCP in Ubuntu
   - Try rebooting the VM
   - If still not working, try `sudo dhclient enp0s3`

**Q: I'm confused about which interface is which!**
A: Run this command to see all interfaces:
   ```bash
   ip addr
   ```
   - The interface with a 10.0.2.x address is your WAN interface
   - The interface connected to the host-only network is your LAN interface
   - Use the actual interface names you see (like enp0s3, enp0s8) in your config files

**Q: Why can't I ping the 10.0.2.x network from my client VMs?**
A: That's normal! The NAT network is only accessible to the router VM. 
   Your clients access the internet through the router's NAT service.

**Q: Can other students see my VMs?**
A: No, your VMs are only visible within your computer. 
   Each student's setup is isolated from others.

## Adapting to Different Network Environments

### If Your Host-Only Network Uses a Different IP Range

If your VirtualBox Host-Only Network uses a different IP range than 192.168.56.0/24:

1. **Check your current Host-Only Network**:
   - In VirtualBox, go to File ‚Üí Host Network Manager
   - Note the IPv4 Address and Network Mask

2. **Adjust Router IP** according to your network:
   - If your host-only network is 192.168.99.0/24 with host at 192.168.99.1:
   - Change router's LAN IP to 192.168.99.2
   - Adjust DHCP range to 192.168.99.100-200

3. **Update All Configuration Files** with the correct subnet

### Working with Classmates

If you're setting up this lab in a classroom with other students:

1. **Make sure your VM names include YOUR NAME** to avoid confusion
2. **Use your own IP range** if possible to avoid conflicts
3. **Check VirtualBox Host-Only Network Manager** to identify your specific adapter

## Understanding the Complete Picture

Your lab creates a setup like this:

1. **Internet** ‚Üí **VirtualBox NAT (10.0.2.0/24)** ‚Üí **Router VM WAN Interface (10.0.2.15)**
2. **Router VM LAN Interface (192.168.56.2)** ‚Üí **Host-only Network (192.168.56.0/24)** ‚Üí **Client VMs (192.168.56.100+)**

This multi-layered setup gives you hands-on experience with:
- Network address translation (NAT)
- DHCP server configuration
- DNS server setup
- IP routing
- Network segmentation

These are the same principles used in real-world networking!

## Required Lab Deliverables

1. **Network Configuration Evidence**:
   - Screenshot of `ip addr` output from router showing both interfaces
   - Screenshot of `ip route` output from router

2. **NAT Configuration Evidence**:
   - Screenshot of `sudo iptables -t nat -L` output
   - Screenshot of `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` showing "1"

3. **Client Connectivity Evidence**:
