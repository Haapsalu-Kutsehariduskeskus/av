## Instructions

1. **Creating the Network Topology**:
   - Open Cisco Packet Tracer
   - Add network devices according to the topology diagram:
     - 4 PCs (PC-0, PC-1, PC-2, PC-3)
     - 1 Management PC
     - 1 Server
     - 4 Switches (Cisco 3560-24PS/3560-24TT)
   - Connect the devices using straight-through cables as shown in the diagram

2. **Configuring VLANs on Switches**:
   - For each switch, access the CLI through console connection
   - Enter privileged EXEC mode: `enable`
   - Enter global configuration mode: `configure terminal`
   - Create VLANs:
     ```
     vlan X0
     name Management
     exit
     vlan X1
     name USERS1
     exit
     vlan X2
     name USERS2
     exit
     vlan X3
     name Servers
     exit
     ```

3. **Configuring Access Ports**:
   - Configure access ports on Switch-1:
     ```
     interface fa0/1
     switchport mode access
     switchport access vlan X0
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```
   
   - Configure access ports on Switch-2:
     ```
     interface fa0/1
     switchport mode access
     switchport access vlan X3
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```
   
   - Configure access ports on Switch-3:
     ```
     interface fa0/1
     switchport mode access
     switchport access vlan X1
     no shutdown
     exit
     interface fa0/2
     switchport mode access
     switchport access vlan X2
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```
   
   - Configure access ports on Switch-4:
     ```
     interface fa0/1
     switchport mode access
     switchport access vlan X1
     no shutdown
     exit
     interface fa0/2
     switchport mode access
     switchport access vlan X2
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```

4. **Configuring Trunk Ports**:
   - Configure trunk ports on Switch-1:
     ```
     interface fa0/23
     switchport mode trunk
     no shutdown
     exit
     interface fa0/24
     switchport mode trunk
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```
   
   - Configure trunk ports on Switch-2:
     ```
     interface fa0/23
     switchport mode trunk
     no shutdown
     exit
     interface fa0/24
     switchport mode trunk
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```
   
   - Configure trunk ports on Switch-3:
     ```
     interface fa0/24
     switchport mode trunk
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```
   
   - Configure trunk ports on Switch-4:
     ```
     interface fa0/24
     switchport mode trunk
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```

5. **Configuring IP Addresses on End Devices**:
   - Configure each PC and server with the appropriate IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway (if needed) according to the Device IP Configuration table

6. **Verifying VLAN Configuration**:
   - On each switch, verify the VLAN configuration:
     ```
     show vlan brief
     show interfaces trunk
     ```
   - Verify connectivity between devices in the same VLAN:
     - PC-0 should be able to ping PC-1 (same VLAN X1)
     - PC-2 should be able to ping PC-3 (same VLAN X2)
     - Management PC should not be able to ping any PC except the Server
     - PCs in VLAN X1 should not be able to ping PCs in VLAN X2

## Expected Results
- Devices within the same VLAN can communicate with each other
- Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate with each other without routing
- Trunk links successfully carry traffic for all configured VLANs

## Explanation

This VLAN configuration setup demonstrates several important networking concepts:

1. **VLAN Segmentation**:
   - VLANs allow logical separation of networks on the same physical infrastructure
   - Network security is enhanced by isolating traffic between different user groups
   - Broadcast domains are reduced to only the devices within each VLAN

2. **Trunk Links**:
   - Trunk ports carry traffic for multiple VLANs
   - IEEE 802.1Q tagging is used to identify which VLAN each frame belongs to
   - Trunk links are essential for extending VLANs across multiple switches

3. **Access Ports**:
   - Access ports belong to a single VLAN
   - Frames entering an access port are assigned to the configured VLAN
   - Frames leaving an access port have any VLAN tags removed

4. **Network Management**:
   - A dedicated Management VLAN (X0) provides separation of management traffic
   - Server VLAN (X3) isolates server traffic from regular user traffic

5. **Network Topology Design**:
   - The hierarchical design with core switches (Switch-1, Switch-2) and access switches (Switch-3, Switch-4) demonstrates best practices
   - Redundant connections between core switches provide failover capability

This VLAN setup provides the foundation for more advanced network configurations including inter-VLAN routing, which would be necessary for communication between different VLANs in a production environment.
