## Instructions

1. **Shutting Down Existing Ports**:
   - Before configuring EtherChannel, shut down the physical interfaces on SW_L3_1 and SW_L3_2:
     ```
     enable
     configure terminal
     interface range fa0/22 - 23
     shutdown
     exit
     ```

2. **Configuring LACP EtherChannel on SW_L3_1**:
   - Create the port channel and configure LACP:
     ```
     interface fa0/22
     channel-protocol lacp
     channel-group 1 mode active
     exit
     interface fa0/23
     channel-protocol lacp
     channel-group 1 mode active
     exit
     ```
   
   - Configure the port-channel interface:
     ```
     interface port-channel 1
     switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
     switchport mode trunk
     switchport trunk allowed vlan 201-203,209
     exit
     ```
   
   - Re-enable the physical interfaces:
     ```
     interface range fa0/22 - 23
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```

3. **Configuring LACP EtherChannel on SW_L3_2**:
   - Create the port channel and configure LACP:
     ```
     interface fa0/22
     channel-protocol lacp
     channel-group 1 mode active
     exit
     interface fa0/23
     channel-protocol lacp
     channel-group 1 mode active
     exit
     ```
   
   - Configure the port-channel interface:
     ```
     interface port-channel 1
     switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
     switchport mode trunk
     switchport trunk allowed vlan 201-203,209
     exit
     ```
   
   - Re-enable the physical interfaces:
     ```
     interface range fa0/22 - 23
     no shutdown
     exit
     ```

4. **Verifying EtherChannel Configuration**:
   - On both switches, verify the EtherChannel configuration:
     ```
     show etherchannel summary
     ```
     This command displays a summary of all EtherChannels on the switch, including their status, protocol, and member ports.
   
   - For more detailed information:
     ```
     show etherchannel detail
     ```
     This command shows detailed information about the EtherChannel, including port state, LACP parameters, and partner information.

## Expected Results

- The `show etherchannel summary` command should display:
  - Port-channel 1 is up with protocol LACP
  - Both Fa0/22 and Fa0/23 are active members (indicated by 'P' for bundled in port-channel)
  - The EtherChannel is operating in Layer 2 mode

- The `show etherchannel detail` command should show:
  - Both local ports are in LACP mode active
  - Partner ports are detected and synchronized
  - Port states are bundled

- Connectivity tests across the network should succeed:
  - PCs in the same VLAN should be able to ping each other
  - Server should be accessible from Management PC (if routing is configured)

## Explanation

This EtherChannel LACP configuration demonstrates several important networking concepts:

1. **Link Aggregation Benefits**:
   - **Increased Bandwidth**: Multiple physical links are combined into a single logical link, providing greater throughput
   - **Redundancy**: If one link fails, traffic automatically flows through the remaining links without disruption
   - **Load Balancing**: Traffic is distributed across the bundled links using a hash algorithm based on source/destination addresses

2. **LACP Operation**:
   - LACP is a standardized protocol (IEEE 802.3ad) for dynamic link aggregation
   - "Active" mode means the switch actively initiates LACP negotiation by sending LACP packets
   - Both switches must support LACP for the EtherChannel to form properly
   - LACP automatically detects configuration issues and prevents misconfigured ports from being added to the channel

3. **Port Channel Interface**:
   - The port-channel is a virtual interface that represents the aggregated links
   - Configuration applied to the port-channel applies to all member physical interfaces
   - The port-channel interface operates as a single logical link for spanning tree, routing protocols, and other network functions

4. **Trunk Configuration**:
   - The EtherChannel maintains the trunk configuration, carrying multiple VLANs
   - Native VLAN configuration ensures proper handling of untagged frames
   - Allowed VLAN list controls which VLANs can traverse the EtherChannel

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Shutting down interfaces before configuration prevents spanning tree issues
   - Identical configuration on all member ports is required for proper operation
   - Consistent configuration on both sides of the EtherChannel is essential

This EtherChannel configuration enhances the network's performance and resilience by providing increased bandwidth and redundancy between the core switches (SW_L3_1 and SW_L3_2).
